	"""
	Function to compute accuracy and F1-score, macro and micro averaged, with the
	option to limit the F1-score only to relevant labels.

	Parameters
	==========
	true_labels: List[int|str]
		The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the true labels
		(ground truth).
	pred_labels: List[int|str]
		The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the predicted
		labels.
	relevant_labels: Optional[List[int|str]]
		If given, it will calculate the F1-score micro and macro averaged only
		over the given labels (relevant ones). Useful for example to remove the
		most common labels from the final metrics.
	prefix: Optional[str]
		If given will prepend `<prefix>_` to the name of the metric. Useful to
		check, for example, what was the split the metric was done in (e.g.
		`eval_accuracy`).

	Returns
	=======
	Dict[str, float]
		A mapping between each of the metrics names (optionally with the
		prepended prefix) and the metric value.

	"""
	Function to compute F1-score, macro and micro averaged for groups of labels
	in sequence tagging. This calculates the labels that have the same root
	(i.e. B and I labels of the same class) into the micro and macro F1-score
	average. It will ignore any label that is not B or I type.

	Parameters
	==========
	true_labels: List[str]
		The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the true labels
		(ground truth). They have to be strings in BIO format.
	pred_labels: List[str]
		The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the predicted
		labels. They have to be strings in BIO format.
	labels: List[str]
		The set of unique labels.
	prefix: Optional[str]
		If given will prepend `<prefix>_` to the name of the metric. Useful to
		check, for example, what was the split the metric was done in (e.g.
		`eval_accuracy`).

	Dict[str, float]
		A mapping between each of the metrics names (optionally with the
		prepended prefix) and the metric value.
